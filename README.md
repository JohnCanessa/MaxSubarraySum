# MaxSubarraySum
Maximum Subarray Sum using Kodane's algorithm

This is a simple algorithm to find the value of the
largest contiguous sub array in a given array.
To top it off it runs in O(n) execution time.

If interested take a look at the following post in my blog:

Keep on reading and experimenting. It is the best way to learn!
